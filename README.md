## Cherished Worlds is a mod that adds the ability to favorite/pin/bookmark certain worlds.

### When installed, empty star icons will appear next to every world on the select screen. Players can bookmark worlds by clicking on the star next to the world icon.

### Bookmarking worlds will force them to always show up at the top of the world selection list and removes the ability to delete them until they are unmarked. Players can bookmark as many worlds as they want. If there are multiple bookmarked worlds, they will internally be ordered by last played date.
